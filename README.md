## FAQ

#### Q: Is my password secure in this bot?
- A: Yes, your password is hashed using a strong algorithm to make it secure. This means that your password is converted into a string of random characters that cannot be easily reversed. Even if someone were to gain access to our database, they would not be able to read your password.

    
#### Q: What happens to my data when I log out of the bot? 
- A: When you log out of the bot, your personal information, such as your username and password, is deleted from the bot's database. This ensures that your data is protected and cannot be accessed by others.
